# NumericalMethodsBigDataProject
Final project for my Numerical Methods and Big Data class. Performed k-means clustering on training data and saw how this affected accuracy of predictions in test data. For open-ended exploration, I came up with 5 additional ways to make predictions in the test set and saw how their accuracy compared to the baseline approach for varying numbers of clusters. These other approaches had two things that varied among them: whether or not the test data was clustered in addition to the training data, and what scheme was used to predict the value of y at a test point given the values outputted at that point by the different regressions.
