# NumericalMethodsBigDataProject
Final project for my Numerical Methods and Big Data class. Performed k-means clustering on training data and saw how this affected accuracy of predictions in a test set; I came up with 5 extra different ways to make predictions in the test set beyond 1 baseline way.
